# Stack Four

## Code

 * The aim is to execute the function complete_level by modifying the
 * saved return address, and pointing it to the complete_level() function.
 *
 * Why were the apple and orange all alone? Because the bananna split.

## Solution

- Now this is getting even more interesting! We still have the `complete_level()` function which is probably still our target of our buffer overflows. The program starts off by calling `start_level()` so we will focus our attention there.

- There is nothing special going on that we haven't seen before. Our good old friend `gets()` is still there along with a buffer and a `void *ret`. At the end of the function `ret` is set to the value of `__builtin_return_address()` which gets the return address of the current stack frame AKA our `start_level()` function. This is done for debugging purposes so that we get some feedback about our exploit.

- This gives us a good idea of the goal for this challenge. For this one we need to use the `buffer` to overwrite the return address for the function with the address of `complete_level()`. This will cause the function to return and execute the `complete_level()` function. 

- This time, we can't get away with using a small buffer of 64 characters because we have to overwrite the return address which is the last value on the stack. Let's do some testing.

- We can use the `info frame` command in gdb in order to print out information about the current stack frame. This gives us information such as the saved registers. The important one is where the saved `rip` is. This is the instruction pointer for the caller. If we overwrite this we can change the execution of the program! Here is an example.

- Now we can begin testing! Lets try an input of 92 characters.

- Here is a screen shot showing the location of the saved `rip`, its current value, and a print out of the stack starting from the base pointer `rbp`. We can see that our input overflowed by 4 bytes into the value of the saved `rip`. Let's start trying to exploit this!

- Looks like it worked! We took 4 bytes (4 `A`'s) off our input, and put in the address of the `complete_level()` function! If we continue the program execution we should return and execute the `complete_level()` function!

- Success!
